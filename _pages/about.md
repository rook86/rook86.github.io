I am an incoming AI engineer at Matsuo Inc./Lab. I majored in computer science and communications engineering at the Advanced Multimedia Systems Lab at Waseda University in Japan (https://www.ams.giti.waseda.ac.jp/). My research focused on video prediction, object detection, and video frame interpolation, and I participated in collaborative research with the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT).
