I am an incoming AI engineer at Matsuo Inc/Lab. I majored in computer science and communications engineering at the Advanced Multimedia Systems Lab ([AMS](https://www.ams.giti.waseda.ac.jp/)) at Waseda University in Japan. My research focused on video prediction, object detection, and video frame interpolation, and I participated in collaborative research with the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology ([NICT](https://www.nict.go.jp/)).
